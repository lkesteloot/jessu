When compiling the JPEG library, compile like this to get the
debug info:

	nmake

and compile like this to get the optimized version:

	nmake nodebug=1

Doesn't seem to make much difference in performance, but the
size is much smaller.

Quality Check
    Empty directory
    Corrupted images
    Very large images
    Very small images (should we skip them?)
    Hidden images and directories

--------------------------------------------------------------------

To do before we can release Jessu 1.1:

- Look through jessu mail folder for other ideas

Done since version 1.0:

- Add a longjmp in the jpeg reading code
- Skip hidden files and directories
- Use less memory
- Faster reading of files
- The "f" key toggles display of filename
- The "p" key toggles pause
- Added flag for less memory, more blurry
- Added flag for default display of filenames
- Can see cursor when paused by moving mouse
- Bias towards top of vertical image
