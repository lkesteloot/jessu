Jessu Screen Saver
------------------

Written by Lawrence Kesteloot and Brad Grantham

What is Jessu?

    Jessu is a screen saver for Windows that displays a
    slide show from your "My Pictures" directory.  The
    pictures have subtle zooms and dissolves to make them
    look more interesting.

    You need a hardware-assisted version of OpenGL for it to
    work.  If you're not sure, try it.  If the zooming looks
    choppy and slow, you need to get a hardware driver for
    OpenGL and possibly a 3D display card.  It may not be
    worth doing all that just for this screensaver.

How to install?

    Run the Jessu.exe installation program.  You can find
    it on our website:

        http://www.plunk.org/jessu

How to uninstall?

    Either run the program "Uninstall" from the Start
    menu (Start -> Programs -> Jessu Screen Saver), or
    go to the control panel, select Add/Remove Programs,
    click on  "Jessu Screen Saver", and click on
    the "Change/Remove" button.

How to run?

    Go to the control panel, select "Display", select the
    "Screen Saver" tab, and choose "Jessu Slideshow" from
    the list.  You can use the "Settings" button to specify
    the folder to display.
