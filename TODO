To do before we can release Jessu 1.2:

- Blank out other monitors
- Fix drawing bugs.
- Update release date in About box

To do:

- Cache the contents of the contrib buffer, not just the buffer
- In paused mode maybe have a border to the left and right (even 5 pixels)
  to show that that's the edge of the picture.
- Add command-line flags to set tile size, etc.
- Be sure it works well in bad situations
    No or old DirectX library
    Cards that have small per-texture (done)
    Cards that have small total-texture size
    Cards that have few bits per pixel
    Only bad files in directory (bad JPEGs)
- Have a different modes where smaller pictures (like 5x7 prints) are
  flying around randomly
- Show a movie clip where a picture would be
- Nicer lack-of-DirectX 8 error message (direct link)

Maybes:

- Select more than one directory to show
- Play music while showing pictures
- Have option to have simple slideshow for slow computers
- Support arrows to go back and forward
- Have a key to rotate the picture and save it
- Show filename after previous picture has faded out 80% (or something) so that
  it doesn't seem to lag the new picture

Bart requests:

- User-configurable fade times and speed
- GIF, PNG, BMP image support
- Video support almost exactly like what I suggested jokingly
    to you a few weeks ago.

For slideshow mode:

- Have Windows Explorer right-click menu item for showing directory
  with Jessu
- Load picture list from file, maybe with per-picture times
- Normally move at certain speed, but can:
    - Pause (space)
    - Move back and forth with arrows (left and right)
    - Resume (space)
    - Pan up and down (up and down)
    - Quit (esc)
- Sync to audio track (?!)

Thoughts about Stand-Alone Mode:

- Have two modes:
    - Organizing
    - Presentation (slide show)
- Organizing mode:
    - Should show thumbnail with additional data:
        - Filename
        - Duration
        - Specific point in picture to zoom into or zoom out of
        - Other zooming or panning instructions
        - Notes to display while showing
        - Audio to play while showing?
        - Automatically-generated text for title slides
    - Use drag-and drop to reorder slides and add slides from Explorer
    - Have pull-down menu items for:
        - Add slide
        - Delete slide
        - Change info
    - Support multiple select of slides
    - Change info dialog box:
        - Edit all additional data
        - Button to delete slide
        - Button to go to next slide, previous slide
    - Show summary information:
        - Total slideshow time
        - Number of slides
        - Audio to play throughout, looping
    - Have way to optimize slide show:
        - Copy all images to single folder
        - Resize images to optimum for loading/scaling
    - Show slides top-to-bottom at left with information at right
    - Always save slideshows as modifications are made with a way to
        undo all changes.  This may be a problem if the user often
        wants to make changes on the fly during presentations.  On
        second thought, maybe it should be the more traditional
        Open and Save model.
    - When open without args, load previously worked-on slideshow
- Presentation mode:
    - Works as it does now
    - <SPACE> pauses, resumes (paused mode goes to fit size)
    - <ESC> goes to organizing mode with current slide selected
    - <LEFT> and <RIGHT> go through slides right away
    - <UP> and <DOWN> scroll while paused
    - <S>, <N>, and <F> changes speed of slide show
    - <+> skips 10 ahead, <-> goes 10 back (maybe not since can
        use organizing mode)
- Reorganization of processes:
    - Make work process be slave of main (graphics) process.  This means:
        - The work process loops idly (blocks?) until the main process
            gives it a specific order:
            - Load this file into this memory
            - Scale and tile this image into here (for texture or thumbnail)
            - Stop and go back to idle mode
        - Work process has no direct knowledge of what the main process
            is doing or its data structures
- Reorganization of data structures:
    - Data structures should be separated out more cleanly so that there's
        no duplication between displayed slides and stored information.
        This probably means wasting more memory in screen saver mode.
    - Try to get rid of all the boolean "so_and_so_is_ready" variables
        and replace them with some state that moves along and can be
        tracked more easily.  Maybe do this with listeners that wait
        for the previous step to finish, or do it with TARGET-like
        system.
