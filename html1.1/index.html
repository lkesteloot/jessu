            <dt><b>What is Jessu?</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Jessu is a screen saver for Windows that displays a
            slide show from your "My Pictures" directory, or any
            other directory you specify.  The
            slide show uses subtle zooms and dissolves to make the
            pictures look more interesting.</p>

            <p>You need a hardware-assisted version of OpenGL for it to
            work.  If you're not sure, try it.  If the zooming looks
            choppy and slow, you need to get a hardware driver for
            OpenGL and possibly a 3D display card.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><b>How do I get it?</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Download and run the
            <a href="Jessu.exe">installer program</a>.  It comes
            with an uninstaller in case Jessu doesn't work on
            your computer. That version will only show the
            first 10 pictures it finds.  That'll give you
            an idea of what Jessu looks like and whether it
            runs smoothly on your computer.</p></dd>

            <dt><b>How can I see all my pictures?</b></dt>
            <dd><p>You can <a href="https://www.swreg.org/cgi-bin/s.cgi?s=31228&p=312281&v=0&d=0&q=1">buy a license for the full version</a>.
            The full version has no limit on the number
            of images it will display.</p></dd>

            <dt><b>What do I need to make it work?</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Jessu uses OpenGL to draw the slide show, so you at
            least need OpenGL drivers.  Also the slide show won't look
            good unless you've got hardware graphics acceleration
            and an OpenGL driver that supports the hardware.  The
            best way to test whether you've got all this is to
            download Jessu and see how it looks.  If the zooming
            is choppy or slow or if nothing shows up at all,
            then you're probably missing drivers and/or hardware.</p>

            <p>If nothing shows up at all full-screen but the little
            preview window (in the Display Properties window) seems
            to work, then it's because drawing full-screen is so
            slow that nothing even shows up.</p>

            <p>If you've got graphics hardware and it's still
            slow (maybe two frames per second), let us know what
            hardware you have and maybe we can fix something
            in our code.  We don't have access to all that many
            different kinds of boards, so it's possible that we're
            doing something that kicks some systems into software-only
            mode.</p>

            <p>We've tested Jessu on Windows 98, 2000, and XP.  Please
            let us know if it works on other platforms.</p></dd>

            <dt><b>What's the latest version?</b></dt>
            <dd><p>We're at version 1.1, released on August
            10th, 2003.  Changes since 1.0:
            <ul>
                <li>Uses far less memory (about 10 MB less, down to 24 MB).</li>
                <li>Has a switch to use even less memory (about 10 MB),
                but this makes the images look slightly blurry.</li>
                <li>Can pause the current image with the 'P' key.
                The up and down arrow keys will scroll the image
                vertically. Moving the mouse will show the cursor
                temporarily so you can point things out to people.</li>
                <li>Can display the filename of the image with the 'F' key.
                There's a preference to have this on by default.</li>
                <li>Skips hidden files and directories.</li>
                <li>More stable and somewhat faster all around.</li>
            </ul></p></dd>

            <dt><b>How can I report problems or bugs or
                make suggestions?</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Please send mail to
            <a href="mailto:jessu@plunk.org">jessu@plunk.org</a>.</p></dd>

            <dt><b>Jessu works fine, but after a few hours the screen
                goes black.</b></dt>
            <dd><p>Make sure that your power saving mode isn't turning
            off your monitor.  In XP, go to Start, Control Panel,
            Power Options.  Look at the settings next to "Turn off
            monitor:".</p></dd>

            <dt><b>Jessu runs very slowly, one frame every few seconds.</b></dt>
            <dd><p>If your computer is more than a few years old, that
            would explain it.  If not, then we've seen some other
            reasons.  For example, some Intel graphics chips revert
            to software rendering for screen savers; we can't figure
            out why.  Also, we've seen Java Swing applications cause
            very slow frame rates in Jessu, we also don't know why.
            And finally some recent sub-notebooks don't run Jessu
            well. We're working to resolve all of these (except
            for the very old computer), so if you feel that Jessu
            should run faster on your hardware, please let us know
            and it will help us fix the problems.</p></dd>
